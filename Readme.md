# array-remove

  Remove a range of elements in an array for both node.js and the browser.

## Installation

Component:

    $ component install staygrimm/array-remove

npm:

    $ npm install array-remove

## API

#### remove(array, from, [to])

Remove a range of elements from given `array`, beginning at index `from` and ending at optional index `to`.  If `to` is omitted, only the element located at index `from` will be removed.

Both `from` and `to` allow negative numbers for locating indices from the end of the array, e.g., `remove(array, -2, -1)` will remove the last and second-to-last elements from the array.

## Example

```javascript
var remove = require('remove-array');
var array = [1, 2, 3, 4];

remove(array, 0, 1); //=> [3, 4]
```
